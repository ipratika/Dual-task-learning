## ðŸ“„ Paper Summary
This work presents a lightweight multi-task framework that jointly performs **drivable area segmentation** and **lane line detection**, using an efficient feature fusion module designed to balance task-specific and shared representations. The model is validated on the **BDD100K** dataset and offers competitive performance even under severe parameter constraints (e.g., 0.03M).

## ðŸš§ Code Availability
The source code will be released soon.  
Stay tuned and thank you for your interest!
